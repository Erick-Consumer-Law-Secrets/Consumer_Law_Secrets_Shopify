The current Shopify website, which is accessible via https://shop.consumerlawsecrets.com
uses Aaron theme.
Said theme has a documentation accesible via https://themessupport.com/documentation/doc/aaron/.
However, no text displays on mobile view.
This issue is unreported to the theme developer presently.
